# Differential_Expression_Analysis-Ballgown-package
This workflow performs differential expression analysis at both the gene level and transcript level using the Ballgown package. 
Unlike traditional methods that require conversion from transcript to gene-level expression, Ballgown allows direct analysis of RNA-Seq data at the transcript level, providing more detailed insights into the expression profiles.

#Key features of the Ballgown package:

Gene-level and transcript-level analysis: Ballgown enables differential expression analysis without the need to collapse transcript data into gene-level summaries, preserving the granularity of the data.
Flexible and efficient: The package can handle large RNA-Seq datasets and perform statistical tests for differential expression while accounting for different experimental conditions.
Visualization: Ballgown offers visualization tools like PCA plots and heatmaps, which help in understanding the overall trends and patterns in the data.
Supports multiple types of measurements: It works with various RNA-Seq quantification formats, such as FPKM, TPM, and raw counts, making it adaptable to different analysis setups.

This method facilitates the discovery of differentially expressed genes and transcripts, and can help identify key biological insights in transcriptomic studies. Whether you're studying gene expression in different conditions, or exploring more nuanced transcript-level changes, the Ballgown package is a powerful tool for RNA-Seq analysis.
